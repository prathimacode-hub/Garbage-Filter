# GARBAGE FILTER

## HACKTABLE 2021

## INSPIRATION
Inspired from the sustainablity I follow up in my life to reduce the ecological footprint and plastic as much as I could.

## MY PROJECT
This project spreads up the awareness and educate the upcoming generations about environmental issues and climatic changes in engaging way. It's basically a game where the trash is been thrown away by the consumers on roads. Here, we as a responsible citizen thriving for a sustainable earth filter out the trash into compost and recycle bins using appropriate keys. It keep track of the points and updates us with the scores simultaneously. This would definitely put individuals on work in gaining wisdom about saving our mother nature from all the malpractises.

## HOW I BUILT IT
I had built it using python including libraries needed and as well had imported assets and sounds to make it more functional and realistic. I had used various classes and functions to call all the objects at right point of time in games functionality. The main file consists of all basic inputs along with user friendly GUI and activated operations for enabled buttons. The score tracking is embedded along with 'p' for pause and 'g' for go. Along with it, I had used 'a' and 'd' keys for compost bins, 'right' and 'left' arrow keys for recycle bin. It's a realistic challenge and can't wait to see judges enjoy this hack. I reason I choose this is to make hackathon fun and also address the pressing issue of the decade. Totally loved building this hack. 

## CHALLENGES FACED
The main challenge was to get all the functionalities right and overcome hell lot of bugs which was indeed daunting. Other troube I had faced is trash stopping abruptly in the middle of the game. I gave my most of the time in solving these issues and got frantic of if I could submit the project on time.

## ACCOMPLISHMENTS
I am proud of what I had accomplished. Contributing a hack to address a well needed environmental issue was exciting to indulge with. Hope that day comes off soon, where plastic is completely banned from usage. Literally, I had to multitask across various other works and squeeze up the best possible time to make this project as pleasing as it can get.

## WHAT I HAD LEARNT
Learnt using python libraries and applying the functionalities and all intregating all the assets and related classes to show up and activate at right point of time when game is running. It was a wonderful learning weekend.

## FUTURE OF GARBAGE FILTER
I would add up more functionalities to make this hack versatile.
